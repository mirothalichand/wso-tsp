WOLF SHEEP OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM FOR SOLVING TSP PROBLEM

The Wolf-Sheep Optimization (WSO) algorithm is an optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of wolves and the grazing behavior of sheep. 

The Wolf-Sheep Optimization (WSO) algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm that is inspired by the hunting and grazing behavior of wolves and sheep in nature.
The idea behind the WSO algorithm is to use the hunting behavior of the wolves to explore the search space and the grazing behavior of the sheep to exploit the
best solutions found so far. In the TSP problem, each wolf represents a possible solution (a route that visits all the cities) and
the fitness of each wolf is evaluated based on the total distance of the route. The WSO algorithm starts with a population of randomly generated wolves, and in each iteration, it updates the position of the wolves
